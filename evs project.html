        In today’s world, as we are developing more and more, we are moving further away from nature. Our development practices are human-centric with no regard and respect for nature and its  original inhabitants.

According to studies, people who have a close connection with nature are healthier, happier, and creative. It aids in their development as responsible and sensitive citizens. The connection of nature is linked to a greater pro-nature conservation behaviour that is crucial for future conservation efforts.

I worked on bird nesting behaviour and participated in several wildlife census across India. In 2010, I did a post-graduation diploma in "Sustainable development of Natural Resources and Conservation" by Ecological society and that was the turning point in my life. I consciously quit architecture and started working for nature conservation and restoration with various NGOs. I then completed my Master’s in Biodiversity and Conservation."
